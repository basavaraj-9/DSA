Array resolves Multiple variable problem

Array data structure
*same type
*contiguous in memory
*Linear Datastructure

#it is defined as 
int marks[5]={99,77,34,76,100,104}

here int is datatype
marks is variable
[5] is the sizeofarray
non primitive
sizeofarray=sizeof(variable)/sizeof(datatype)

#array runs from 0 t0 size-1 (or) n-1
